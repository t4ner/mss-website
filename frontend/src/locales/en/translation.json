The author hereby expressly declares that at the time of setting the link, no illegal content was visible on the linked pages. The author has no influence on the current and future design, content, or authorship of the linked/ associated pages. Therefore, the author distances himself explicitly from all content of all linked/associated pages that were changed after the link was set. This statement applies to all links and references set within the author's own internet offer as well as to foreign entries in guestbooks, discussion forums, directories, mailing lists, and all other forms of databases where external write access is possible. For illegal, incorrect, or incomplete content, and especially for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information, only the provider of the page referred to is liable, not the one who simply refers to the respective publication via links."
